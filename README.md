# QEMU on Android - Windows 10 32-bit

## Requirements
- **RAM**: At least 16 GB (for 32-bit version)
- **Architecture**: Aarch64, ARM, i686, or x86_64
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for ISO and VM images
- **Network**: (Optional) Configure as needed

## Installation Steps

1. **Install Termux**:
   - Get Termux from F-Droid or the Google Play Store.
   
2. **Update and Upgrade Termux**:
   ```bash
   pkg update -y
   pkg upgrade -y
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pkg install qemu sdl x11-repo -y
   pkg install qemu-system-x86_64 -y
   ```

4. **Create a QCOW2 Image**:
   ```bash
   qemu-img create -f qcow2 /storage/emulated/0/ISOs/windows10-32bit.qcow2 16G
   ```

5. **Start the VM with the ISO**:
   ```bash
   qemu-system-x86_64 -m 4096 -hda /storage/emulated/0/ISOs/windows10-32bit.qcow2 -cdrom /storage/emulated/0/ISOs/Win10_32bit.iso -boot d -display vnc=:0 -net nic -net user
   ```

## Notes
- **Experimental**: This setup is experimental and may not work perfectly on all devices. Performance can vary based on device specifications and available resources.
- **Performance**: Allocating more RAM to the VM may affect overall device performance. Be prepared for possible delays during startup and operation.
- **Networking**: Ensure proper network configuration if required.

## Troubleshooting
- If the VM fails to start or you encounter issues, consider adjusting the allocated RAM or checking network configurations.
